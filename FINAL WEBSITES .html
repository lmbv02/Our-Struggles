  <h1 class="niceFont" style="text-align:center"> What is Foster Care?</h1>
    <p1 class="niceFont"> Many people have heard of Foster Care, however there are various misconceptions of it. By definition it is a a temporary arrangement in which adults provide for the care of a child or children whose birthparent is unable to care for them. Foster parents can last with a child as long as needed, may it be for a week or 5 years. The end goal is for the child to go back to their biological parents. The dilema is, after 5 years is it emotionally healthy for a child to go back to strangers or stay with the family that raised them?   </p1>
    <h1 class="niceFont" style="text-align:center"> Three Parts of this Story</h1>
    <p2 class="niceFont"> Usually, news outlits focus on the birthparents abuse or maltreatment, however they never bring light to the fact that the child is returned to a unfit parent and the foster parents distress. Although, every case is different, birthparents are getting away with abusing kids and getting them back. Foster parents basically dedicate their life to raise and provide a loving home for these kids, for them to just be taken away it is dentrimental for all three parties.
