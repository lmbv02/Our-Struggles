        <p>On the outskirts of Cairo, Egypt,  the Zabbaleen (garbage people) are a population of seven settlements. The most prominent settlement is in Mokattam village, which has a nickname of "garbage city" The Zabaleen have a duty of recycling trash of all sorts (glass, plastic, metal, paper, food, etc.) that are brought from the cities. This work is very laborous and difficult because there has to be a certain amount of recycled material each day. Men, women and children are involved in this recycling process. In fact, some children, as young as 9 or 10 do this work.</p>

        <p> The Zabbaleen people live in very poor environmental conditions due to polluted air and trash everywhere they go. </p> This makes the Zabbaleen very prone to disease and consequently, high mortality rates for children and infants. As one would imagine, handling the trash is risky and dangerous because one could encounter sharp objects and needles. Furthermore, the community is absent of basic services such as health care and good education, which parents very much desire for their children. Another large problem is low income because the residents receive barely enough money to sustain themselves and their family. We <em> need </em> to find a better way to eliminate the trash of Cairo, in order to improve the lives of the Zabbaleen</p>

         <p> Overview</p>
         <p>  Since the certainties demonstrate that a huge number of these returned war veterans are on the whole being looked with these difficulties at the present time! Things are being done to encourage them however there can at present be significantly more done to guarantee that the general population that battled for our flexibility come back to the simple nation that they battled for with help so they can have a decent upbeat life like us. The principal thing I think should be possible is, put a conclusion to destitute veterans. The general population that are out battling for us to have the capacity to live securely in our homes ought not return home and not have one of their own. There benefit has earned them that right. The second thing, Help veterans land positions. Joblessness is a genuine national issue, yet as I would see it, a veteran ought to land more help getting positions. The exact opposite thing that I think should be possible is, encourage analyze and battle veterans experiencing Post-awful pressure issue. PTSD is a huge issue with our veterans. this is a significant issue and I feel that the most ideal approach to treat the issue, is to bring issues to light for it and not be embarrassed about it. It is accounted for that almost half of veterans experiencing PTSD don't report their concern.
